Create a table Employees:
EmployeeId				=== PK
Firstname
Lastname
Department
Salary
ReportsTo				=== FK

Create at least 15 records in Employees.

----------------------------------------------

Write queries:
Q.1) to get total salary of each department.
Q.2) to get highest and lowest salary of each department.
Q.3) to return the following data: EmployeeId, Firstname, Lastname, ReportsTo, Firstname of reporting manager, Lastname of reporting manager.
Q.4) Top 5 salaried employees (id, firstname, lastname, salary).
Q.5) Bottom 5 salaried employees (id, firstname, lastname, salary).

-------------------------------------------------

RANK(): Order values and assign them numbers in some order. For duplicate values, same no. is assigned and the next sequence is skipped.
DENSE_RANK(): Order values and assign them numbers in some order. For duplicate values, same no. is assigned and the next sequence is not skipped.
ROW_NUMBER(): Assigns nos. starting with 1 to specified criteria (PARTITION BY) and duplicate records will have continuous sequence (1,2,3...). Non-duplicate records will only have the no. 1.

Ex. Top 5 salaried employees:
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW emp_view AS (SELECT DENSE_RANK() OVER(ORDER BY salary DESC) AS DenseRank, employees.emp_no, first_name, last_name, salary
	FROM salaries
	JOIN employees ON employees.emp_no = salaries.emp_no
	WHERE to_date = '9999-01-01');
SELECT * FROM emp_view
WHERE emp_view.DenseRank <= 5;

Or alternatively,

SELECT * FROM	
    (SELECT DENSE_RANK() OVER(ORDER BY salary DESC) AS DenseRank, employees.emp_no, first_name, last_name, salary
	FROM salaries
	JOIN employees ON employees.emp_no = salaries.emp_no
	WHERE to_date = '9999-01-01') x
WHERE x.DenseRank <= 5;

Using the employees database downloaded from: https://github.com/datacharmer/test_db

Q1) Write a query that will give details of all the employees:
emp_no, firstname, lastname, current department, current title, current salary.
Q2) Top 5 salaried employees. DON't USE LIMIT.
Q3) Top 5 salaried employees for 'Finance' department.
Q4) Bottom 5 salaried employees.
Q5) Bottom 5 salaried employees for 'Development' department.
Q6) Total Salary per department. (dept, total salary).

Q7) Select the employees that are getting the salary that is greater than the average salary of the department they are working in.
